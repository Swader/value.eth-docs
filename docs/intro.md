PermaLock is a liquidity locking protocol for Uniswap V3 and V4 LP position
NFTs. It lets projects and LPs lock positions permanently or for a fixed
duration while continuing to collect fees.

## What PermaLock does

- Lock V3 or V4 positions with a permanent or time-based expiry.
- Route trading fees to a fee recipient while the position is locked.
- Keep the core protocol fully on-chain with no indexer requirements.
- Minimize admin surface area: fees, deposit pause, and rescue operations only.
